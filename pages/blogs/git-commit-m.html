            I'm sure everyone who is on this page has atleast used Git or Github once. While version control is a lifesaver for us clumsy code breaking devlopers. I've often found myself and other developers to be particularly not exactly verbose for their commits,
            and I get it! You got your code to run after a 1000 edits and now you want me to think of a commit message! But writing small edits isn't going to cut it either. So this blog is for me to come back to and for people who often have one word
            commit messages.

            <strong>Why you need good commit messages?</strong>
            <p>
                This past one month, I've been working a lot on React and updating my portfolio. Which means a lot of git commits, and also means me breaking my code several times. A good commit message comes handy in here. Let me show you with a bad example.
                <img class="blog-img" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*1jYLHBrHV2Bsz-d5WuxTOA.png" alt=""> Your code is broken, you need to revert back to a previous state to make sense of it now. That means going through the commit history and
                reverting back to a point where most of things if not everything was working properly. Now image having to look through a comit history like the image shown below.
                <img class="blog-img" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1041/0*2H8DOwD0jeKAvLgH.png" alt=""> It's a nightmare right? Checking out and testing every commit to see which one is which. This is the point in time you start wondering if you'd
                have taken some time to write a meaningful commit message. Well it's never too late to start.

        <h2> Here are some tips for your future commit messages.</h2>
        <p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li class="blog-points">Make a multi line commit. A good commit has 3 parts : Subject, body and footer.</li>
                <li class="blog-points">Limit the subject to 50 characters and be sharp about the changes.</li>
                <li class="blog-points">The subject is a single line that best sums up the changes made in the commit.</li>
                <li class="blog-points">Wrap the commit body in 72 characters. This makes developers to look at commit messages on the small terminal.</li>
                <li class="blog-points">The footer is optional, write future changes to be made, tests to be done or parts to be reviewed here.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
