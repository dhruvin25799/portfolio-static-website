        <p>Time management is one of the most underrated yet highly effective skills in the industry right now. As cognitive misers of this generation, we've never been taught or even learned time management. We're all struggling with our instant gratification
            monkey
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU&ab_channel=TED" target="_blank">(See this TEDx video)</a>, at some point in life when you're managing multiple stuff, be it as simple as managing college and personal time, we need some
            kind of mechanism to manage our time or else everything ends up in chaos. While this chaos is manageable and fun during college years when you're working it's a whole new nightmare. This article will help us take control of the self gratification
            monkey and manage time to not procrastinate.</p>

        <h2>Time Management Matrix<small> by Stephen R. Covey</small></h2>
        <p>
            Invented by Stephen R. Covey in his critically-acclaimed book : The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, this time management matrix is a proposed way to compartmentalize the various items in your life, based on its level of urgency and importance.
            <img class="blog-img" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/1*2ET-mOLjOdctffp_x6xj5A.png">
            <p>
                As seen above there are 4 quadrants in the matrix, they can be defined as :
                <ul>
                    <li class="blog-points"><strong>Important and Urgent (Q1)</strong> — Tasks for immediate crises and emergencies, such as deadlines.</li>
                    <li class="blog-points"><strong>Important but Not Urgent (Q2)</strong> — Items for pre-planning, improvement, and prevention of emerging problems and tasks.</li>
                    <li class="blog-points"><strong>Not Important but Urgent (Q3)</strong> — Includes ongoing and busy tasks that are filled with occasional interruptions.</li>
                    <li class="blog-points"><strong>Not Important and Not Urgent (Q4)</strong> — Exclusively filled with time wasters.</li>
                </ul>
                It can be extremely challenging to prioritize tasks and put them into these quadrants at first. We often fall into living within the parameters of Quadrant 1 (Q1), where urgency takes priority over everything. However a person who manages time will be
                more inclined to keep this Quadrant empty as much as possible by planning tasks ahead of time and putting them in Quadrant 2 (Q2). Thus making urgency not the same as importance.<br> However Quadrant 1 (Q1) cannot be ignored
                for tasks that come in at the last minute. Emergencies and last minute crisis can come up anytime and it's important to be ready to handle them. By managing tasks and keeping Q1 empty we can free up time for such crisis at the moment and
                be ready.<br> Our internal gratification monkey has the notorious habit of spending time in Quadrant 3 (Q3). It is a comforting place to be in. It is filled with items that are urgent but not of utmost importance. This includes checking
                email 1000 times (which I'm very guilty of) or scrolling through social media and replying to absolutely every message ever. There's nothing wrong with taking a break but such trivial tasks should be managed under Quadrant 4 (Q4).
            </p>
        </p>


        <h2>How to make most out of your time managing time!</h2>
        <p>
            When in doubt, it's always a good idea to paper it out! The traditional way of writing things on paper and drawing the matrix is the most effective as it will allow your mind to think of tasks as concrete and not digital. For items you want to put in
            Q1 and Q3, figure out a way to restructure them into Q2.<br> Q2 is the place everything is supposed to be, planned and in execution, no surprises!
